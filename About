I have made a code learning platform named as "Codify".
In this platform those who want to learn webdesign and basic programming language like Java & Python they can easy learn from here.
Download the complete file/folder to view all effects of javascript, jquery & css.
In this Project i have made my own text editor/ player for the codes of html, css, javascript..
In the text editor/player you have to click on html,css,javscript button made in top bar to show respectively dialogbox.
